# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

lvm2-compat32:
lvm2-compat32: Heinz Mauelshagen's LVM (Logical Volume Manager) for Linux.
lvm2-compat32: LVM adds an additional layer between the physical peripherals and the
lvm2-compat32: low-level I/O interface to get a logical view of disks.  This allows
lvm2-compat32: the concatenation of several disks (so-called physical volumes or PVs)
lvm2-compat32: to form a storage pool (so-called Volume Group or VG) with allocation
lvm2-compat32: units called physical extents (called PE).  With LVM, you can extend,
lvm2-compat32: resize, or relocate storage dynamically.
