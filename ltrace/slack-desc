ltrace: ltrace (Tracks runtime library calls)
ltrace:
ltrace: Ltrace is a debugging program which runs a specified command until the
ltrace: command exits.  While the command is executing, ltrace intercepts and
ltrace: records both the dynamic library calls called by the executed process
ltrace: and the signals received by the executed process. Ltrace can also
ltrace: intercept and print system calls executed by the process.
