libsamplerate-compat32: libsamplerate-compat32 (Sample rate conversion library for audio data)
libsamplerate-compat32:
libsamplerate-compat32: Secret Rabbit Code is a sample rate converter for audio. It is
libsamplerate-compat32: capable of arbitrary and time varying conversions. It can downsample
libsamplerate-compat32: by a factor of 12 and upsample by the same factor. The ratio of
libsamplerate-compat32: input and output sample rates can be a real number. The conversion
libsamplerate-compat32: ratio can also vary with time for speeding up and slowing down
libsamplerate-compat32: effects.
