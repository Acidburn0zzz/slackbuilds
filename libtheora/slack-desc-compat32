libtheora-compat32: libtheora-compat32 (Theora video codec library - 32 bit)
libtheora-compat32:
libtheora-compat32: Theora is Xiph.Org's first publicly released video codec, intended
libtheora-compat32: for use within the Foundation's Ogg multimedia streaming system.
libtheora-compat32:
libtheora-compat32: The Theora bitstream format was frozen after the alpha3 release. This
libtheora-compat32: means that files produced by the alpha3 encoder will always be
libtheora-compat32: playable according to the Theora I specification. Traditionally
libtheora-compat32: alpha means a proof of concept, not a production-ready release. 
libtheora-compat32: However the code is very robust, ready for and indeed in general use.
