check-compat32: check-compat32 (A unit test framework for C - 32 bit libraries)
check-compat32:
check-compat32: Check is a unit test framework for C. It features a simple interface
check-compat32: for defining unit tests, putting little in the way of the developer.
check-compat32: Tests are run in a separate address space, so Check can catch both
check-compat32: assertion failures and code errors that cause segmentation faults or
check-compat32: other signals. The output from unit tests can be used within source
check-compat32: code editors and IDEs.
