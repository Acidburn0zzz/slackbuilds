hal-compat32: hal-compat32 (The HAL Hardware Abstraction Layer)
hal-compat32:
hal-compat32: HAL is a piece of software that provides a view of the various
hal-compat32: hardware attached to a system.  HAL keeps detailed metadata for each
hal-compat32: piece of hardware and provides hooks so that system and desktop
hal-compat32: software can react to changes in the hardware configuration (such as
hal-compat32: the insertion of a DVD, or a USB flash memory stick).  Users in the
hal-compat32: "plugdev" or "cdrom" group will be able to use such devices on the
hal-compat32: desktop without the need to mount/umount them manually.
