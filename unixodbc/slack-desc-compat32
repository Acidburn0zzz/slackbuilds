unixodbc-compat32: unixodbc-compat32 (A complete ODBC driver manager for Linux -- 32bit)
unixodbc-compat32:
unixodbc-compat32: Install unixODBC if you want to access databases through ODBC. This
unixodbc-compat32: package includes low-level drivers for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and local
unixodbc-compat32: files. However, the included drivers are not as up-to-date as the
unixodbc-compat32: ones distributed separately. It is recommended that you install and
unixodbc-compat32: use the MyODBC package if you need a driver for MySQL, and/or the
unixodbc-compat32: postgresql-odbc package for PostgreSQL.
