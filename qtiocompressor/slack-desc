qtiocompressor: qtiocompressor (QIODevice that compresses data streams)
qtiocompressor:
qtiocompressor: The class works on top of a QIODevice subclass, compressing data
qtiocompressor: before it is written and decompressing it when it is read. Since
qtiocompressor: QtIOCompressor works on streams, it does not have to see the entire
qtiocompressor: data set before compressing or decompressing it. This can reduce the
qtiocompressor: memory requirements when working on large data sets.
