enblend: enblend (Image Blending with Multiresolution Splines)
enblend:
enblend: Enblend is a tool for compositing images, given a set of images that
enblend: overlap in some irregular way, Enblend overlays them in such a way
enblend: that the seam between the images is invisible, or at least very
enblend: difficult to see.  Enfuse combines multiple images of the same subject
enblend: into a single image with good exposure and good focus. Enblend and
enblend: Enfuse do not line up the images for you, use a tool like Hugin to do
enblend: that.
