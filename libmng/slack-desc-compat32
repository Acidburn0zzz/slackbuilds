libmng-compat32: libmng-compat32 (Multiple-image Network Graphics library-- 32 bit)
libmng-compat32:
libmng-compat32: This is libmng, the MNG reference library.  MNG (pronounced 'ming'),
libmng-compat32: is short for Multiple-image Network Graphics.  Designed with the same
libmng-compat32: modular philosophy as PNG and by many of the same people, MNG is
libmng-compat32: intended to provide a home for all of the multi-image (animation)
libmng-compat32: capabilities that have no place in PNG.
