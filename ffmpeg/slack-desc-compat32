ffmpeg-compat32: ffmpeg-compat32 (Video and audio converter - 32 bit)
ffmpeg-compat32:
ffmpeg-compat32: FFmpeg is a very fast audio and video converter.  It can also grab
ffmpeg-compat32: from a live A/V source. The command line interface is designed to be
ffmpeg-compat32: intuitive, in the sense that FFmpeg tries to figure out all the
ffmpeg-compat32: parameters, when possible.  You have usually to give only the target
ffmpeg-compat32: bitrate you want.  FFmpeg can also convert from any sample rate to
ffmpeg-compat32: any other, and resize video on the fly with a high quality polyphase
ffmpeg-compat32: filter.
