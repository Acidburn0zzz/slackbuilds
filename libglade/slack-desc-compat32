# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libglade-compat32:
libglade-compat32: The GLADE library allows loading user interfaces which are stored
libglade-compat32: externally into a program.  This allows the interface to be changed
libglade-compat32: without recompiling the program.  The interfaces can also be edited
libglade-compat32: with GLADE.
