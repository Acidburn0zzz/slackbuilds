jbig2dec: jbig2dec (A decoder implementation of the JBIG2 image compression)
jbig2dec:
jbig2dec: jbig2dec is a decoder implementation of the JBIG2 image compression
jbig2dec: format. JBIG2 is designed for lossy or lossless encoding of 'bilevel'
jbig2dec: (1-bit monochrome) images at moderately high resolution, and in
jbig2dec: particular scanned paper documents. In this domain it is very
jbig2dec: efficient, offering compression ratios on the order of 100:1.
