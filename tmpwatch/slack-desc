tmpwatch: tmpwatch (A utility for removing temporary files)
tmpwatch:
tmpwatch: The tmpwatch utility recursively searches through specified
tmpwatch: directories and removes files which have not been accessed in a
tmpwatch: specified period of time.  Tmpwatch is normally used to clean up
tmpwatch: directories which are used for temporarily holding files (for example,
tmpwatch: /tmp).  Tmpwatch ignores symlinks, won't switch filesystems and only
tmpwatch: removes empty directories and regular files.
