twolame-compat32: twolame-compat32 (A optimized MPEG Audio Layer 2  encoder - 32 bit)
twolame-compat32:
twolame-compat32: TwoLAME is an optimized MPEG Audio Layer 2 encoder. It is based on
twolame-compat32: tooLAME by Mike Cheng, which in turn is based upon the ISO dist10
twolame-compat32: code and portions of LAME.
twolame-compat32: Because of patent issues surrounding the MPEG Audio Layer 3 (MP3)
twolame-compat32: encoders, the ability of most MPEG Audio players to play layer 2
twolame-compat32: files, and the similarity in command-line syntax and API, TwoLAME
twolame-compat32: makes a very good drop-in replacement for LAME or other layer 3
twolame-compat32: encoders.
