fuse: fuse (Filesystem in Userspace)
fuse:
fuse: FUSE is a simple interface for userspace programs to export a virtual
fuse: filesystem to the Linux kernel.  FUSE also aims to provide a secure
fuse: method for non privileged users to create and mount their own
fuse: filesystem implementations.
fuse: Note: For security reasons only members of the group "fuse" are
fuse: allowed to (u)mount fuse filesystems. See
fuse: /usr/doc/fuse-${VERSION}/README.security
