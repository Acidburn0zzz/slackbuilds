mpfr-compat32: mpfr (Multiple-Precision Floating-Point Reliable Library -- 32 bit)
mpfr-compat32:
mpfr-compat32: The MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point
mpfr-compat32: computations with exact rounding (also called correct rounding).
mpfr-compat32: It is based on the GMP multiple-precision library.
mpfr-compat32: The main goal of MPFR is to provide a library for multiple-precision
mpfr-compat32: floating-point computation which is both efficient and has 
mpfr-compat32: well-defined semantics.  It copies the good ideas from the
mpfr-compat32: ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for double-precision floating-point arithmetic
mpfr-compat32: (53-bit mantissa).                             http://www.mpfr.org/
