libgssglue-compat32: libgssglue-compat32 (Generic Security Services Application Library)
libgssglue-compat32:
libgssglue-compat32: This library exports a gssapi interface, but doesn't implement any
libgssglue-compat32: gssapi mechanisms itself; instead it calls gssapi routines in other
libgssglue-compat32: libraries, depending on the mechanism.
