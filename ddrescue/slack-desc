ddrescue:
ddrescue: GNU ddrescue is a data recovery tool. It copies data from one file or
ddrescue: block device (hard disc, cd-rom, etc) to another, trying hard to
ddrescue: rescue data in case of read errors. GNU ddrescue does not truncate the
ddrescue: output file if not asked to. So, every time you run it on the same
ddrescue: output file, it tries to fill in the gaps.
