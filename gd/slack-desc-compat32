# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

gd-compat32:
gd-compat32: gd is a graphics library.  It allows your code to quickly draw images
gd-compat32: complete with lines, arcs, text, multiple colors, cut and paste from
gd-compat32: other images, and flood fills, and write out the result as a PNG or
gd-compat32: JPEG file.  This is particularly useful in web applications, where
gd-compat32: PNG and JPEG are two of the formats accepted for inline images by
gd-compat32: most browsers.
