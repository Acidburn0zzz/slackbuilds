pango-compat32: pango-compat32 (Text rendering library)
pango-compat32:
pango-compat32: Pango is a library for layout and rendering of text, with an emphasis
pango-compat32: on internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout
pango-compat32: is needed; however, most of the work on Pango-1.0 was done using the
pango-compat32: GTK+ widget toolkit as a test platform. Pango forms the core of text
pango-compat32: and font handling for GTK+-2.0.
