+		 * it was called using an invalid salt format.  Previous
+		 * versions of glibc would go ahead and compute a DES hash

+		 * formats (for example, if the account was locked using
+		 * "passwd -l".  To handle this situation, we will recompute
+		 * the hash using a hardcoded salt as was previously done
+		 * by glibc.  The hash returned by the old glibc function
+		 * always began with "!!", which would ensure that it could
+		 * never match an otherwise valid hash in /etc/shadow that
+		 * was disabled with a "!" at the beginning (since the second
+		 * character would never be "!" as well), so we will also
+		 * prepend the resulting hash with "!!".  Finally, in case
+		 * crypt() failed for some other reason we will check to see
+		 * if we still get NULL from crypt even with the valid salt
+		 * and will fail if that's the case.
