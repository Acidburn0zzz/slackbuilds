re2c: re2c is a tool for writing very fast and very flexible scanners.
re2c: Unlike anyother such tool, re2c focuses on generating high efficient
re2c: code for regular expression matching. As a result this allows a much
re2c: broader range of use than any traditional lexer offers. And Last but
re2c: not least re2c generates warning free code that is equal to 
re2c:hand-written code in terms of size, speed and quality.
