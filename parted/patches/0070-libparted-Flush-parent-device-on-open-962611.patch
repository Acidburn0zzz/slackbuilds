Subject: [PATCH] libparted: Flush parent device on open (#962611)

Parted probes for filesystems using geometry offsets into the parent
device, not the partition device itself. This means it may get stale
information if a partition has just been formatted.

On kernels before 2.6 this will also flush all partition devices. On 2.6
and newer kernels it will only flush the parent device.

* libparted/arch/linux.c (linux_open): Always call _flush_cache
