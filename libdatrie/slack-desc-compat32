libdatrie-compat32: libdatrie-compat32 (Double-array trie library)
libdatrie-compat32:
libdatrie-compat32: Trie is a kind of digital search tree, an efficient indexing method
libdatrie-compat32: with O(1) time complexity for searching. Comparably as efficient as
libdatrie-compat32: hashing, trie also provides flexibility on incremental matching and
libdatrie-compat32: key spelling manipulation. This makes it ideal for lexical analyzers,
libdatrie-compat32: as well as spelling dictionaries.
