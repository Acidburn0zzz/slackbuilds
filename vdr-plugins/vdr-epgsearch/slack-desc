vdr-epgsearch:
vdr-epgsearch: This plugin provides a powerful replacement for VDR's default
vdr-epgsearch: schedules menu entry.  It looks like the standard schedules menu, but
vdr-epgsearch: adds several functions, such as additional commands for EPG entries,
vdr-epgsearch: reusable queries which can be used as dynamic "search timers" etc.
