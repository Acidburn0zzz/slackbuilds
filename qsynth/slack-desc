qsynth: qsynth (Qt based Fluidsynth GUI front end)
qsynth:
qsynth: QSynth is a fluidsynth GUI front-end application written in C++ around
qsynth: the Qt4 toolkit using Qt Designer. Eventually it may evolve into a
qsynth: softsynth management application allowing the user to control and
qsynth: manage a variety of command line softsynth but for the moment it wraps
qsynth: the excellent FluidSynth. FluidSynth is a command line software
qsynth: synthesiser based on the Soundfont specification.
