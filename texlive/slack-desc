texlive: texlive (Binaries for the TeX formatting system)
texlive:
texlive: TeXLive is an implementation of TeX for Linux or UNIX systems. TeX
texlive: takes a text file and a set of formatting commands as input and
texlive: creates a printable file as output. Usually, TeX is used in
texlive: conjunction with a higher level formatting package like LaTeX or
texlive: PlainTeX, since TeX by itself is not very user-friendly.
