qtlockedfile: qtlockedfile (QFile extension with advisory locking functions)
qtlockedfile:
qtlockedfile: This class extends the QFile class with inter-process file locking
qtlockedfile: capabilities. If an application requires that several processes should
qtlockedfile: access the same file, QtLockedFile can be used to easily ensure that
qtlockedfile: only one process at a time is writing to the file, and that no process
qtlockedfile: is writing to it while others are reading it.
