perl-carp-clan: perl-carp-clan (Report errors from perspective)
perl-carp-clan:
perl-carp-clan: This module reports errors from the perspective of the caller of a
perl-carp-clan: "clan" of modules, similar to "Carp.pm" itself. But instead of giving
perl-carp-clan: it a number of levels to skip on the calling stack, you give it a
perl-carp-clan: pattern to characterize the package names of the "clan" of modules
perl-carp-clan: which shall never be blamed for any error.
