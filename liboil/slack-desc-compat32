liboil-compat32: liboil-compat32 (Library of Optimized Inner Loops, CPU optimized functions)
liboil-compat32:
liboil-compat32: Liboil is a library of simple functions that are optimized for
liboil-compat32: various CPUs. These functions are generally loops implementing simple
liboil-compat32: algorithms, such as converting an array of N integers to
liboil-compat32: floating-poing numbers or multiplying and summing an array of N
liboil-compat32: numbers. Clearly such functions are candidates for significant
liboil-compat32: optimization using various techniques, especially by using extended
liboil-compat32: instructions provided by modern CPUs (Altivec, MMX, SSE, etc.).
