sqlite-compat32: sqlite-compat32 (Library that implements an embeddable SQL database)
sqlite-compat32:
sqlite-compat32: SQLite is a C library that implements an SQL database engine. A large
sqlite-compat32: subset of SQL92 is supported. A complete database is stored in a
sqlite-compat32: single disk file. The API is designed for convenience and ease of
sqlite-compat32: use. Applications that link against SQLite can enjoy the power and
sqlite-compat32: flexibility of an SQL database without the administrative hassles of
sqlite-compat32: supporting a separate database server. Version 2 and version 3
sqlite-compat32: binaries are named to permit each to be installed on a single host.
