# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libjpeg6:
libjpeg6: Software to implement JPEG image compression and decompression.  JPEG
libjpeg6: (pronounced 'jay-peg') is a standardized compression method for
libjpeg6: full-color and gray-scale images.  JPEG is intended for compressing
libjpeg6: 'real-world' scenes; cartoons and other non-realistic images are not
libjpeg6: its strong suit.  JPEG is lossy, however, on typical images of
libjpeg6: real-world scenes, very good compression levels can be obtained with
libjpeg6: no visible change, and amazingly high compression levels are possible
libjpeg6: if you can tolerate a low-quality image.
