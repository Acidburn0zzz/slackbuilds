libpipeline: libpipeline (A pipeline manipulation library)
libpipeline:
libpipeline: libpipeline is a C library for setting up and running pipelines of
libpipeline: processes, without needing to involve shell command-line parsing which
libpipeline: is often error-prone and insecure.  This alleviates programmers of the
libpipeline: need to laboriously construct pipelines using lower-level primitives
libpipeline: such as fork(2) and execve(2).
