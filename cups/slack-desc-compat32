# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

cups-compat32:
cups-compat32: The Common UNIX Printing System provides a portable printing layer for
cups-compat32: UNIX(R)-like operating systems. It has been developed by Easy Software
cups-compat32: Products to promote a standard printing solution for all UNIX vendors
cups-compat32: and users.  CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol ("IPP") as the
cups-compat32: basis for managing print jobs and queues.  The CUPS package includes
cups-compat32: System V and Berkeley command-line interfaces, a PostScript RIP
cups-compat32: package for supporting non-PostScript printer drivers, and tools for
cups-compat32: creating additional printer drivers and other CUPS services.
